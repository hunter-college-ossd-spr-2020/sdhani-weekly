## Plot-Twist @ Half-Time

***Caught by remote surprise.*** Amid the growing concerns over the spread of COVID-19, all of our in-person courses are in the process of being converted into "distant-learning" formats for the remainder of the spring semester. As I write this now, I'm currently unsure of what that format looks like, and even less sure about what that format means for my team's collaboration workflow for our **Next.js** contributions. Admittedly, while I do prefer face-to-face collaborations, it will be interesting to see what challenges in communication we face as a team and how we choose to adapt and overcome them. ***If this course was going to give us a true taste for the Open Source Developing World, then what better way to practice true remote communication?***

#### `commit message Wednesday March 11 2020`: 
***Test Driving the Product***. My teammate shared this awesome next.js *[crash course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkOVe40Sy0U)*. I have completed about 25% of the video so far, and hope to complete the entire crash course by the end of next week.

#### `commit message Saturday March 14 2020`: 
***No one's perfect***. Even the most well-thought out projects are bound to have some issues and **Next.js** is no exception. Unfortunately it appears that most of the issues flagged as [good first issues](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/labels/good%20first%20issue) fall within three categories: they are either pretty involved, they already have a decent amount of people working on them, or they were opened years ago. This at face-level can seem pretty daunting, so our group plan's to organize a discussion about this next week. I spoke to my teammates, and we are currently monitoring the activity on [this backlog](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/issues/8090) issue and communicating if we want to take action on it. 
Other issues that are interesting but rapidly changing are
- [More inclusive documentation for next.js #9537 ](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/issues/9537)
- [Update examples with getInitialProps to SSG Â· Issue #11014](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/issues/11014)

### [Open Source is Not About You](https://gist.github.com/richhickey/1563cddea1002958f96e7ba9519972d9)
The frustration in this rant is palpable, but I suppose, after reading some odd 100 or so different issues and pull requests across dozens of projects, I understand where it's coming from. Some of the complaints that I've seen are just either downright mean, petty, or vague. After seeing a few hundred of these, I can see how it can drive any core-maintainer nuts. However, while I do understand that it's ridiculous to expect the "*inventor to [become the] community manager*," in an Open Source project its perhaps an unavoidable cost for any *artist* who puts their work out there. My favorite quote from the piece was *"If you have expectations (of others) that aren't being met, those expectations are your own responsibility. You are responsible for your own needs. If you want things, make them."*. I can relate to the above in some of the challenges that I've faced with the Next.js installation process. If I see something that can be improved I should *just do git* :smile:.
