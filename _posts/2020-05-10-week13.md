## Open Source Fundamentals..? :dizzy:

### Thoughts on "Makers and Takers" by Dries Buytaert :thinking:

Buytaert's article (or much-rather theses :joy:) explores a lot of economic practices--both foundational and experimental--and their potential applications to successfully _scaling_ and _sustaining_ Open Source Projects. Before he gets to the juicy details of the golden three business models for _public goods_ (privatization, centralization, and self-governance) he introduces the idea of **_Makers_** and **_Takers_**.

**_All hail the creators :art:._** Buytaert's naming of the _good guys_ in the uptopia of open source is not without its purpose. The term _makers_ paints a picture of active self-starters, go-getters, creators. They are the very fabric of any Open Source project, _"investing in code"_, _"fixing bugs"_, and _"growing the community of contributors"_.

**_Gorg, the Takers :moneybag:._** Takers are companies that use Open Source projects but chose not to give back to those project despite having the means to. Buytaert paint a picture of selfish and greedy proprietors.

**_Buytaert's Assessment :pencil2:._** Takers harm open source projects, and force Makers to become Takers. Sounds simple enough, an _us_-vs-_them_ concept, or a contangious "greed". Buytaert's solution to this rivalry is the adoption of a public good business model. His exploration and research into the various public models types are interesting at base level, but his entire argument relies on the assumption of the darwinistic nature of company competition. His opening belief is that competition hurts and destroys good companies financially. If a proprietary company uses an open source software (belonging to an Open Core Company) and does not contribute to it, then their competition with the Open Core Company will ultimately lead to the destruction of the Open Core Company by either A) making them more proprietary or B.)costing them users. This is the conditional that Buytaert presents us with. While there is probably some truth or proof of his assessment somewhere, its hard to imagine this is always the case. I'm no expert, but is it possible that proprietary competition doesn't always have to decimate an open source company? Maybe the competition can further push and encorage open source communities to grow and thrive in amazing ways that it couldn't before. Maybe.

### `$ cd Next.js`

### `$ git log --reverse`

#### `commit message Thursday May 7` :sound::

Code reviewed some PRs that my awesome team members made to our Next.js project example for the Next.js + MongoDB pairing. After merging Michelle's code for our shared task into our team's production branch (the `with-mongodb` branch), I started building on top of those changes to add the tasks left. My goal was to remove any external dependencies that was not related to MongoDB and Next.js from the project, which meant that a great deal of refactoring was needed for the client-side of our application.

#### `commit message Friday May 8 - Sunday May10` :nerd_face::

I spent the entire weekend going through the project and refactoring out the previous style library we were using to test the code. The advantage of this that our application is now lighter dependency-wise and easier to read without the complications associated to library components. In addition to this, I also modularized some rendering logic and functionality logic and fixed any small errors or bugs that I encountered. There weren't many because my team did an amazing job!! :heart::blush:. I opened this [PR](https://github.com/hunter-college-ossd-spr-2020/next.js/pull/28) to our collaboration branch.
