## What's Next---.js for Team TON?
---

### `$ cd Next.js`
### `$ git log --reverse`

#### `commit message Friday March 27`:
I started to make some significant progress on [The Next.js Handbook](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-next-js-handbook/). I'm on my way to becoming a `Next.js` intermeadiate user (more or less :joy:). This process is necessary if our team plans to contribute an example `Next.js` project to the main repo (see week 08). In support of this goal, I also started looking at potential topics we could base an example project off of. It's a little tricky determing what technologies would be useful to pair with `Next.js` that haven't already been done. I've looked into incorporating a `SQL` [Knex](http://knexjs.org/) / `Next.js` technology fusion of some kind, but this idea needs a little more time to bake. Some things I will need to research before making a feature request for this kind of example include:

- ***Does a `Knex`/`Next.js` technology pairing make sense?*** <br>
Is it relevant?

- ***Are there any existing PRs, issues, discussions, of chats related to using Knex with `Next.js` in the project?*** <br>
Whose using it, if anyone? Are there issues with combining the techs?

- ***Actually look into building a `Knex`/`Next.js` demo application.*** <br> 
Is it within my team's capability? If not, what extra resources are needed to get us there?

#### `commit message Saturday March 28 ~1:00`: 
***Way to go team TON!***  So my *awesome* group took up some space on closed *and* merged PR's today for the `Next.js` project! [@MichelleLucero](https://hunter-college-ossd-spr-2020.github.io/MichelleLucero-weekly/) went typo hunting in the Next.js project and spear-headed our need to jump on some changes we were discussing about for some time as a group. So we finally attacked! Sure there were some accidental commits made to the project's "master" branch called `canary` on our fork, and a few reforks required to remove our corrupted `canary` branch history, but we made it! Our first set of contributions to Next.js. These contributions are small independently, but together as a team, it adds an immeasurable amount towards our enthusiasm and prospects. The feeling is surreal in the best way possible, and definitly makes us a little more comfortable about the contribution workflow to a real, big FOSS project. *trying to contain excitement*

***Tweaks for the Greater Good.*** Due to the accidental commits and merges made to the `canary` branch on our fork (and the intricacies involved with navigating a single repo with four write-access priveleged members), it was time to get a little creative. In addition to coming together as a team on what workflows to avoid moving forward, I added a *Branch Protection Rule* to our fork.

Before making this rule I read up on [protected branches](https://help.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/about-protected-branches) and settled on requiring [pull request reviews before merging](https://help.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/about-required-reviews-for-pull-requests) to the `canary` branch. Hopefully, this prevents us from doing something potentially dangerous to the `canary` branch in the future :joy:.

### Contributions Made This Week:
- Made a PR request for a typo in a README file for the Next.js project.
- Some of my peers wanted some help setting up emoji-support for their blogs and naturally I couldn't resist :blush: :star2:! So I issued some blog PR's that involved setting that feature up for them! Can't wait to check out their blog posts :100:!
