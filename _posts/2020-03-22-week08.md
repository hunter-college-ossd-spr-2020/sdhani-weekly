## Kicking it Remote :karate:

<!-- Continue to chronicle your activities related to the project on which you are now working, in detail. Treat the blog as its name's derivation implies.
This week has been eventful, and it has greatly impacted everyone's lives. For you as students it has a different impact than it does for others, and it has an impact on our plans for this course. Write about how it has changed things for you, and as an interesting exercise, write how you think the situation will be in four weeks and in eight weeks. -->
